An OS written to help me learn programming.

# FAQ
_Q: Why is it named "TsundokuOS"?_

A: Because this is the definition of the word: Tsundoku (Japanese: 積ん読) is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them.
And that's what will probably happen to the stuff I learn while programming it.
